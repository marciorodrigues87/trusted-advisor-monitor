# trusted-advisor-monitor
Polls AWS Trusted Advisor API and sends its results to Slack

## Next steps
- Another kind of storage, currently we just keep the previous results in memory to avoid duplicated notifications
- Get AWS Resource Tags, currently we don't even try to get them
- Better README with all configuration options
- Docker
- CI
